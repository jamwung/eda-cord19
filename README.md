# Exploratory Data Analysis on the CORD-19 Dataset

![Title](title.png)

This project showcases exploratory data analysis techniques and SQL queries via Python API.

## Overview

This repository aims to investigate and identify thought leaders in the field of COVID-19 research, recognizing individuals or groups who have made significant contributions to understanding and mitigating the pandemic's impact. In a world where pandemics like HIV/AIDS and Influenza have been addressed through research and remedies, the absence of an instant antidote for COVID-19 poses a unique challenge. By analyzing and evaluating the extensive body of COVID-19 research, we hope to shed light on those who have played a crucial role in softening the blow of this pandemic and may hold the key to finding a solution.

## Datasets

The dataset used for this analysis includes a comprehensive collection of COVID-19 research papers, studies, and publications. This dataset will be meticulously curated and processed to extract relevant information about the researchers and their contributions to COVID-19 research. It can be accessed through the following channels:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
- [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org/data/cord-19)
- [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/cord-19/)

To supplement this core dataset, data on publications from [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org) were also considered for further analyses.

## Key Highlights

- Notable authors such as Ralph Baric (USA), Kwok-Yung Yuen (China), Shibo Jiang (China), Ziad Memish (Saudi Arabia), Christian Drosten (USA), and others have emerged as prominent contributors to COVID-19 research.
- The countries leading in COVID-19 research, citations, and researchers are the United States, China, and the United Kingdom.
- Key concept tags associated with COVID-19 research include Biology, Virology, Medicine, Virus, and Coronavirus.
- Early research efforts may have contributed to a decline in the death rate in subsequent months.

These findings highlight the significant roles played by individuals, institutions, and countries, primarily China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, in combating the pandemic. While the data may not encompass the entire scope, it emphasizes the impact of research on slowing down the pandemic and aiding in global recovery. These results can serve as valuable insights for future research and pandemic preparedness efforts.
